            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is very important to use descriptive names when naming your files so you don't get confused when using the file explorer and trying to access all of the files.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Microsoft Paint to modify this image (I do not endorse using Paint to modify images)</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was 2121 X 1414 pixels</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I Used compressor.io to compress this image</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The second image has noticeably less quality than the original.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
               <svg width="100" height="100">
                <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="cyan" stroke-width="4" fill="orange" />
               </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I looked up how to make an SVG since I have no idea what it really is or its purpose.</p>
